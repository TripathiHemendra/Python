# Here's a simple Python project idea: Building a To-Do List CLI Application using object-oriented programming.

# Project Overview
# This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) based To-Do List application. Users can add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as complete. We'll use Python's input() function for CLI interaction and store tasks in a list.

# Code Structure
# Task class: Represents a task with attributes like title and status (complete or incomplete).
# ToDoList class: Manages the list of tasks with methods to add, view, and complete tasks.
# Main CLI loop: Accepts user commands to interact with the task list.

# Explanation
# Task Class:

# Each task has a title and a completed status (initially set to False).
# mark_complete(): Marks the task as complete by setting self.completed to True.
# __str__(): Returns a formatted string representation of the task for display.
# ToDoList Class:

# self.tasks: A list that holds all task objects.
# add_task(title): Adds a new task to the task list.
# view_tasks(): Displays all tasks, showing their title and completion status.
# complete_task(index): Marks a task at the given index as complete.
# Main CLI Loop:

# Displays a menu and takes input from the user.
# Based on the userâ€™s choice, it adds, views, or marks tasks as complete.
# Loop continues until the user chooses to exit.
# Running the Program
# When you run the program, the CLI provides the following menu:

# Add a task: The user can input a new task title.
# View tasks: Lists all the tasks with their status.
# Mark task complete: Marks a task as complete by entering its number.
# Exit: Exits the program.
# This project can be easily extended with more features like task priority, due dates, or saving tasks to a file for persistence.
